## "Llamachat " is a client for llama (or any other model) for Groq

- Use your own api key (ROQ_API_KEY in .env.local)
- Enjoy
- Live version deployed here https://customchat.vercel.app/ (with my free api key - prepare for rate limits)

## Notes:

- If you don't have Groq API key, get one here: https://console.groq.com/keys
- Chat history and variables are saved in LocalStorage 
- Variables are a cool way to reuse prompt components
- Dark mode! Responsive!
